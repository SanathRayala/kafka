Kafka:

Pub/Sub model:
Pub(Producer) <---------------> [Message Broker {Kafka Server} ]  <-------------------> Sub(Consumer)

Arch & Components [Core components]:

->Producer:

->Consumer:

->Broker:

->Cluster:
	Group of Servers/Brokers
	There can be multiple brokers inside a cluster
	eg: if there is alot of data produced by producer then a single broker couldn't manage then we can get extra from cluster
	
->Topic:
	Its present inside broker
	You can add Topics according to data
	prd,con will produce or consume data to/from topics
	
->Partitions:
	eg: prod is sending millions of messages to topic
	can topic handle those many messages? its very challenging
	In such senarios we can use partitions
	and distribute them across diff machines[This concept is called topic partitioning] and each part is called Partition.
	this helps for high performance.
	
->Offset:
	Its basically the index of data
	eachtime the data goes in to partition, It will be assigned to a offset[index]
	why?
	if a consumer is consuming data from partition and it goes down, again it will come online then it will continue based on this offset
	
->Consumer Group:
	Consumer Group is a group of consumers.
	eg:alot of data in partions can't be assigned to a single consumer
	so same as dividing topics-> partitions,here consumer group will have manay consumers each consumer can be assigned to a partions
	this concept is called consumer load balencing
	
->Zookeeper:
	It tracks the status of your kafka cluster, Kafka topics,partions,offsets etc....
	
Kafka CLI
kafka commands

1)start Zookeeper  [ .\zookeeper-server-start.bat ..\..\config\zookeeper.properties ] 2181
2)start kafka server or broker [ .\kafka-server-start.bat ..\..\config\server.properties ] 9092
3)create topic [.\kafka-topics.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic cwg-topic --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1]
--topic <name of topic>
--partitions <number of partions>
--replication-factor <number>

.\kafka-topics.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --describe --topic prac-topic
it will describe topic

.\kafka-topics.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
this will list all the topics

4)start producer [.\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic cwg-topic]
5)start consumer [.\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic cwg-topic --from-beginning]
